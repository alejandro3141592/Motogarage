# Motogarage

In this project the design of a garage for motorcycles was made for the EDAG company, implementing at the same time different sensors and actuators for enhancing the user experience.

This project included the design in SolidWorks and the manufacture of the scale model of the Motogarage. This scale model, in addition to showing the idea of the design, also acted as a validation for the electronic circuits proposed for automating the garage.

For this, I designed the PCBs of power and control, which allowed me to enhance the user experience. Among the features the model demonstrated was the implementation of automatic lights, that turned on when the door was open, and off when it was closed; the implementation of a safe lock system using an electromagnetic solenoid; the development of an RFID reader, that unlocked the door with the right card and the development of an App, with which I could control the lights and the lock.

In addition, I also developed the code needed for the microcontroller, and the App using the MIT App Inventor software.
