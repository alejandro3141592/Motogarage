I contributed to the project with part of the design in SolidWorks of the structure of the Motogarage.
I also designed the PCBs of power and control for the scale mode of the moto garage.
In addition, I developed the programming of the microcontroller to make the control of several sensors and actuators.
Finally, I made an App in the software of MIT App Inventor, with which I could control the model.
