# Motogarage

In this project the design of a garage for motorcycles was made, implementing at the same time different sensors and actuators for enhancing the user expirience.

I contributed to the project with part of the design in SolidWorks of the structure of the Motogarage.
I also designed the PCBs of power and control for the scale mode of the motogarage.
In addition, I deveolped the programming of the microcontroller to make the control of several sensors and actuators.
Finally I made an App in the software of MIT App Inventor, with wich I could control the model.
